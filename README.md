# Car_Price_Analysis

This project explores used car sales data to uncover trends and insights into pricing, vehicle conditions, and market demand. Key analyses include price relationships with car attributes, brand quality, market anomalies, and regional pricing strategies. Visualizations aid in identifying potential deals.

# Dataset Summary

The **Car Prices Dataset** contains over 550,000 records from used car sales between 1982 and 2015. It includes key details like year, make, model, condition, mileage, pricing (including asking price and Manheim Market Report (MMR) price), body type, transmission, VIN, state, color, and seller. The average car year is around 2010, with an average mileage of 68,323 miles and a condition rating scaled from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). This dataset is ideal for analyzing pricing trends, market dynamics, and regional preferences in the used car market.

# Key Analytical Focus

- **Relationship Between Selling Price and Market Price**: How closely does the actual selling price of cars correlate with the market-recommended price (`mmr`), especially for newer models?

- **Impact of Car Age and Condition on Price**: How does a car’s manufacturing year and condition affect its selling price? Is the expected depreciation observed across different car brands and conditions?

- **Influence of Body Style on Pricing**: How do various car body styles (SUV, Sedan, Convertible, Coupe) influence the selling price? Are there notable trends in which body styles command higher or lower prices?

- **Brand and Condition Analysis**: Which car brands, combined with condition ratings, lead to the highest or lowest selling prices? How do different brands compare when considering the average condition of their vehicles?

- **Ford F-150 Trim-Level Analysis**: Among Ford F-150 trucks, how do different trims (e.g., XLT, Platinum) affect selling prices? Which trim level offers the best value for buyers?

- **Color-Based Pricing Trends**: Do certain car colors tend to sell for more than the market-recommended price (`mmr`)? Which colors consistently fetch higher or lower selling prices?

- **Regional Pricing Insights**: Which states offer the best deals for buyers, particularly for trucks? Are there regional differences in how vehicles are priced compared to the market price, and where do the most affordable deals occur?

- **Mileage and Price Correlation**: How does a car’s odometer reading influence its selling price, particularly across different brands? Are there brands that experience steeper price declines with higher mileage?


# Summary of Findings

- **Relationship Between Selling Price and Market Price**: A strong correlation exists between the recommended market price (`mmr`) and actual selling prices, particularly for newer models, validating the market price as a reliable benchmark for vehicle value.

- **Body Styles and Condition**: SUVs and newer vehicles consistently command higher prices. Cars in better condition tend to be priced higher, while higher odometer readings lead to lower selling prices, especially for premium brands like BMW, where price declines steepen as mileage increases.

- **Ford F-150 Focus**: The Ford F-150 "XLT" trim offers an affordable, feature-rich alternative to premium trims like Platinum. The XLT model is especially attractive in states like Utah, where below-market deals were frequently observed.

- **Color-Based Price Variation**: Vehicles in popular colors like red and black tend to sell at a premium above the market price, whereas less common colors, such as orange, perform poorly and are priced below market expectations.

- **State-Specific Insights**: Utah stands out as a favorable location for buying trucks, especially Ford F-150 models, where ample inventory and low prices make it a key market for below-market purchases.


## Limitations of the Findings:

- The analysis is limited to the available dataset, which may not account for recent market fluctuations or trends outside the provided data.

- The dataset does not factor in vehicle features (e.g., technology or safety features) that could influence pricing independently of the variables analyzed.

- The findings do not account for potential regional variations in tax policies or other factors affecting final selling prices in different states.
